# Library Project

The top level goal is to design a simple library with an In Memory Data Store - May be extended to use LocalStorage or Firebase.

The main focus is to demonstrate developer's ability to 
  - Organize a JavaScript code base 
  - Use and understand JavaScript patterns such as constructor and/or factory
  - Use vanilla Javascript to achieve the above tasks
  - Use `Linters` to follow coding styles (both on local machines and on GitHub)
